# Digital Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of marketing campaigns to determine the Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) for different channels like Social Media, SEO, and PPC. The final output is a budget allocation recommendation based on channel efficiency.

## Key Findings
- The analysis reveals all marketing channels have similar CPAs (~$5.7k) and conversion volumes. No single channel is dominant. Therefore, a balanced, diversified budget allocation is the optimal strategy to ensure stable, predictable growth and mitigate risk. This data-driven approach maximizes overall ROI.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python and Pip installed.
2. Create a virtual environment and run `pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib`.
3. Run the main Python script to perform the analysis and generate the `cpa_by_channel.png` chart.
